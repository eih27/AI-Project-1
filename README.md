# AI-Project-1
Rock-Paper-Scissors CNN Model
This project is an exploration of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the ESP32S3 Sense microcontroller to classify rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures. My goal is to not only build a working model but also gain a deeper understanding of data collection, preprocessing, and deploying machine learning models on microcontrollers.


Hardware:

Xiao ESP32S3 Sense microcontroller.
Camera module for image capture.
USB-C cable for flashing firmware and data transfer.

Software:

Python for model training and data preprocessing.
MicroPython for running scripts on the ESP32S3 Sense.
TensorFlow/Keras for building the CNN model.
OpenCV & NumPy for image processing.
ESP toolchain for firmware flashing.
